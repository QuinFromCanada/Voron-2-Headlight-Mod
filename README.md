# Voron-2 Headlight Mod

Headlight Mod for the Voron V2.4, its a way to add RGB into an unused part of the Voron build.

The mod can be insalled into any stocked V2.4.  It can be installed in Series with the stealth burner or onto its own driver (if your board has multiple drivers, such as the BTT Manta).
